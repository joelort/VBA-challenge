# VBA-challenge

I'm sorry but yesterday I uploaded my projects but since the code file was not the right ono, I uploaded the good one.I hope this is not too late.

This challenge was hard. I couldn't do more, than that. When I started getting into it, it was too late.

My code only works for making the columns, the names, and tickers for every year in the worksheet.

I tried to  have a different approach but in the end, it was not possible.

I use some resources from the internet with some adaptions for my project.
